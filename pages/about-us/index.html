                Funding Turkey was created to establish and manage real estate
                investment funds and venture capital investment funds within the
                framework of the Capital Markets Law and relevant legislation
                provisions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our company aims to provide investors with low risk and high
                return with funds established and managed on the basis of real
                estates with high return potential and promising ventures with
                its professional and experienced staff who are experts in their
                fields.
              </p>
              <p>
                We came from humble roots. Through the invaluable personal
                experience of our Founder/CEO Cameron Deggin. Through his years
                of building and running Turkey’s finest real estate EcoSystem,
                Deggin determined the next natural

            <div class="half col-md-6 col-12">
              <p>
                growth path for our company and our investor clients was through
                the tradition of real estate investment funds. Although natural
                for Property Turkey, it was quite a revolutionary idea. In
                Turkey, prior to us, only big banks and large institutions had
                operated substantial REIT’s and VCIF’s.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, Funding Turkey blazes the trail for real estate companies
                who aspire to compete with the titans of the investment
                industry. It’s only through our expertise and innovation that we
                have been able to stay at the top and gain an edge on larger,
                slower competitors.
              </p>
              <p>
                We build on a great history stretching back into the last
                century. And our future in this century shines bright with
                growth and promise.

                PROPERTY TURKEY ECOSYSTEM One of the distinguishing factors when
                comparing PT Fund to similar competitors in the market is PT
                Fund’s Management Structure; Specifically its optimization of
                the Property Turkey EcoSystem. It is very common for other funds
                to partner with third party companies along up and down the real
                estate stack. Many funds do this because they have specific
                skills in purely managing assets. But in reality, when investing
                in real estate you want your managing partners to have expertise
                in managing assets AND investing in real estate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Property Turkey has decades of experience as a leader in the
                Turkish real estate market, specifically when it comes to
                servicing foreign buyers. That growth and expansion positions
                Property Turkey as real estate experts first and
              </p>

                asset managers second, a unique perspective in a largely
                homogenous industry. It also allows for advantages in the
                portfolio acquisition and distribution of funds for PT Fund.
                Property Turkey has long had the infrastructure in place to
                service the needs of clients from legal, to the purchase of
                land, building of houses, resale properties, investment
                projects, vacation villas, rental and property management, and
                beyond. Property Turkey is a full stack real estate company
              </p>
              <p>
                So for PT Fund, that means there is no need to outsource when it
                doesn’t benefit the profitability of the fund. In our view this
                is the most streamlined, efficient, agile and productive
                pipeline that exists in the Turkish market.

            <div class="half col-md-6 col-12">
              <p>
                At Funding Turkey, and Property Turkey, we pride ourselves on
                our sterling reputation in the Turkish real estate industry.
                What’s in our name? As a client you will find accountability,
                directness, partnership, and transparency in our name.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the greatest competitive advantages Funding Turkey has in
                this space is experience and expertise. That’s based off of
                decades of real estate market participation at the highest
                levels in Turkey. We are real estate people who use money to
                build great real estate portfolios. We are not money people who
                use real estate to create money portfolios. We have found great
                real estate portfolios provide much better returns in
                comparison.
              </p>

            <div class="half col-md-6 col-12">
              <p>
                We don’t enjoy being “sold” to and we operate under the
                assumption that neither do our clients. At Funding Turkey we
                value your time and we value our time. We always try and
                prioritize efficiency in a fast moving market.
              </p>
              <p>
                That mutual respect ripples through our core philosophy as we
                value our clients as partners in our investment ventures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Part of being partners in any endeavor, is having the ability to
                hold each other accountable. At Funding Turkey we invest our own
                money alongside our clients. We have “skin in the game.” This
                caliber of accountability leads to better decisions and better
                relationships.

            <div class="half col-md-6 col-12">
              <p>
                Our investment criteria is quite simple, yet it has been
                distilled down and perfected over years of real estate deal
                making. We have seen it all in Turkish real estate since 2001,
                good deals, bad deals, scams, you name it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The type of real estate property doesn’t matter as much to us as
                being to apply these three principles to any real estate
                transaction:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Buy Below Market Value - We need to get in low relative to
                comps and other market expectations. Our elite real estate
                network usually acts as the catalyst for opportunities that
                others can’t access.

            </div>
            <div class="half col-md-6 col-12">
              <p>
                2. Ensure Stable Income - The Turkish market is emerging onto
                the global scene. But, it has a reputation as being more
                volatile compared to developed markets. It is vital to be able
                to secure reliable and stable income from our assets month after
                month. That is why we have established our own in-house Property
                Management company to service all of our assets.
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Ensure an Easy, Profitable Exit - Once again, our full-stack,
                all-encompassing real estate ecosystem ensures a clean exit
                every time. That is due to the liquidity Property Turkey’s
                marketplace opens up for our assets.

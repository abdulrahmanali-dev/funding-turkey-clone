              A real estate investment fund is a collection of assets without a
              legal personality. They are deemed a legal person only at the Land
              Registry, and title deeds are issued in its name. REIFs are
              subject to regulations of the Capital Markets Board in the
              Republic of Turkey. The fund consists of a portfolio composed of
              the following:
            </p>
            <p>
              • Money
              <br />
              • Real Estate Holdings
              <br />
              • The real estates and the rights based on them ,<br />
              within the scope of projects having the construction licenses that
              are carried out by the Prime Ministry of Housing Development
              Administration, Iller Bankasi AS, municipalities, and their
              affiliates.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4 col-12 article-col">
            <p>
              These assets and transactions are collected from qualified
              investors in return for participation shares. Funds can be
              established by:
              <br />
              • Portfolio Management Companies
              <br />
              • Real Estate Portfolio Management Companies
              <br />
              • Real Estate and Venture Capital Portfolio Management Companies
              <br />
              Which can be established subject to the permission of the Board,
              temporarily or indefinitely with fund rules. Funds can be
              established to invest in certain real estate properties, or to
              operate within a specific sector, or they can be established
              without any restrictions on purpose.

              In short, a REIF is an investment instrument that converts real
              estates into capital market instruments through securitization.
